Right now the development is a little out of whack, but works like this:

you start vscode, open the GuestBook folder, and the do an "open-in-container".  This  needs to be fixed so git will work inside here.

Then you start in a separate window the developmental webserver gbweb using docker-compose up (see local_mode.md)
